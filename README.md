Application for a Waveshare ESP32-S3-Pico based Waveshare Nixie Clock.

This is very much a work in progress though the basic clock operation works as a NTP synchronised clock.
Much of the work is based on Waveshare's Rpi Pico original but it has been extensively modified for WiFi and NTP.

A 3D printed case to replace the Waveshare aluminium case has beed designed using Openscad to allow use of WiFi.

ToDo: Provide remote WiFi configuration, HTML based configuration, psuedo file storage (SPIFFS) for configuration data, Timezone and Daylight saving configuration

Files for this device saved for later editting etc.

To be expanded when possible.
